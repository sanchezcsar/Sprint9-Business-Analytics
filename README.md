# 🎟️ Marketing Analytics for Showz – Customer Profitability & CAC Analysis

This project was part of my internship in the analytics department at **Showz**, a ticket sales company. The goal was to **optimize marketing spending** by understanding user behavior, revenue contribution, and customer acquisition costs over time.

## 📦 Data Sources
- Web server logs: user sessions and traffic data (Jan 2017 – Dec 2018)
- Order records: customer purchases and amounts
- Marketing spend statistics: acquisition costs by channel and time

## 🧠 Business Questions Addressed
- How do customers interact with the Showz platform?
- When do new users start making purchases?
- What is the lifetime value (LTV) of a customer?
- How long does it take for revenue to cover the cost of acquiring a customer (CAC payback period)?

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Cohort analysis
- Retention curves
- ROI and payback period calculations

## 📈 Outcome
The project provided insight into:
- Optimal acquisition windows
- Customer segments with the highest profitability
